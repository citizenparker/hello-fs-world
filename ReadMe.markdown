# Hello, World in F# for the Web #

This is a straightforward project that represents the minimum setup to get going on a new F# web project. It's a grand total of 5 lines of code to do the following

* Define a default page at the website root
* Determine which NDjango page will render the result
* Define a function to act as a controller
* Put a value on the response stack to be consumed by the NDjango view

Not bad, eh? Why not clone/fork this project and get started on your own F# project?

Please contact Scott Parker with any questions or concerns. You can reach me by sending a message to github.com/citizenparker, or via my blog at http://citizenparker.com
